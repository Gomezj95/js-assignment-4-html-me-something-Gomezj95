                        Hello! This is a brief overview of my work history up till now. Almost like an informal resume. I graduated from high school in 2014. 
                        I enter the workforce right afterwards. With no experience, connections or education, I went to the retail and service industry. 
                        I eventually found my way to the IT field and am currently trying to climb into the software development sector.

                     <h3>Home Depot</h3>
                     <p>
                        Working at Home Depot is what I consider my first real job because of my full-time status and how long I stayed there. 
                        Even though it's just a big retail box store for construction materials, I did learn a lot of transferable skills. I felt a big boost in my soft skills as a very awkward teen. 
                        I worked several roles, such as paint associate, cashier, customer service rep. 
                        My favorite thing about this job was the relationships I built with my co-workers. Good times, overall!

                     <h3>Wyndham Garden Hotel</h3>
                     <p>
                        I worked as a front desk associate at the Wyndham Garden Hotel. It was an interesting and fairly short experience since I only worked here for a couple of months. Again, I feel like working at this job reinforced my safety and communication skills. Handling difficult situations was a regular part of the job.

                     <h3>Simpay</h3>
                        <p>
                           Simpay was a credit card processing company where I worked for about 3 years. It was my first IT job. 
                           At first, getting accustomed to working at an IT desk was a hurdle, but it was definitely rewarding. 
                           It gave me the confidence to understand that I could do more than just customer service work. 
                           I got my COMPTAI A+ while working this job as well. 
                           It was a blast learning about "What is the internet?" and "How do CPUs really work?" 
                           <br><br>The bread and butter of this job was the supporting point of sales equipment. 
                           This company usually leases small credit card terminals to merchants with small businesses. It was my job to support the credit card terminals. 
                           I also did miscellaneous tasks like managing credit card batches as well. Overall, it was a great learning experience. It prepared me for future service desk roles. 
                           I realized what you support might change, but the process of troubleshooting stays the same from service desk to service desk.

                     <h3>Accenture</h3>
                     <p>
                        I did a short internship at Accenture. I worked as a service desk analyst. It was similar to the work I did at Simpay, but instead of supporting merchants, it was office workers. I liked the experience of working with more common hardware, like laptops, desktops, and printers. My co-workers were awesome and were the best part of the job.

                     <h3>Penn Medicince</h3>
                     <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                        Penn Medicine is where I'm currently working as a service desk analyst. I've held this job for about 2 years so far. I work from home, which is a big bonus. I learned a lot about the technology used in the health field and the general inner workings of the health system. I've become pretty proficient in my role and gained additional responsibilities. Overall, this job was a great learning experience, but I feel the amount of personal growth that can be made in my current role is drying up, and I'm looking forward to the horizon for new opportunities.
